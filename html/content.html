                    In this data-driven era, we generate data in terabytes (TB). My purpose is to create something new and serve it to the world.
                    Like many others, my initial interest lay in app development, and I have some experience in basic app development. However, as a fascination whose favorite character is IRON MAN and who is curious about how mobile devices can recognize their owners and How robots talks to Humans, I realized that my true passion lies in AI.Data science has been my primary area of interest for a year now, and I am particularly enthusiastic about deep learning. I am proficient in Python. I am passionate about helping others and enjoy working in a team.
